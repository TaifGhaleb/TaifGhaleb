# 👋 Hi, I'm Taif

I'm interested in system behavior, networking, and security — especially how different operating systems, tools, and configurations interact in real environments.

I work across Windows, macOS, Linux, and virtualized environments (VMware / VirtualBox), focusing on troubleshooting, configuration, and analyzing root causes instead of surface-level fixes.

### 🔧 Technical Interests
- Multi-OS systems & virtualization  
- Networking & basic cybersecurity  
- System diagnostics & problem analysis  

### 🛠️ Current Tools
Windows | macOS | Linux  
VMware | VirtualBox

### 📌 Notable Work
- Reported a **partial lockdown bypass** in Safe Exam Browser (remote mouse input during SEB lockdown mode).
